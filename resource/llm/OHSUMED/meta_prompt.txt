Your task is to optimize <prompt>prompt</prompt> such as show below:
<prompt>
{description_prompt}
</prompt>

The prompt template contains template variables 'text_label_pairs' and 'target_label'. Given an input set of template variables, the formatted prompt is then given to an LLM to get an output.

Below are some previous prompts with their scores. The score ranges from -1(worse) to 1(better).

{prompts_scores}

Some examples of template variable inputs and expected outputs are given below to illustrate the task.

{prompt_samples}

We run every input in an evaluation dataset through an LLM. If the LLM-generated output doesn't match the expected output, we mark it as wrong (lower scores).
A correct answer has a score of 1. The final "score" for a prompt is the average of scores across an evaluation dataset.
Write your new prompt (<prompt>prompt</prompt> ) that is different from the old ones and has a score as high as possible.
